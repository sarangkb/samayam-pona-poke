## Project Description

## The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)  
KTU students stare at a never-ending loading screen for results longer than they studied for the exam.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built an website that mokes the ktu website ,and shows a loading screen with never ending questions for entertainment that never makes any sence
